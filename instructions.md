>**ADVENTURE IS ONE OF THE MOST FASCINATING AND CHALLENGING GAMES AVAILABLE FOR YOUR APPLE COMPUTER. WINNING IS QUITE A CHALLENGE IN A GAME WHERE IT MAY TAKE HOURS TO MOVE AND WEEKS TO SOLVE A PUZZLE. HI-RES ADVENTURE # 1 (*MYSTERY HOUSE*) TAKES PLACE IN AN OLD HOUSE WITH MANY ROOMS. AS YOU ENTER THE HOUSE, SEVEN OTHER PERSONS WILL BE IN THE LIVING ROOM. EVENTUALLY THEY ARE DISPERSED THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE AND YOU START FINDING THEM -- DEAD! YOU MUST FIND THE KILLER BEFORE HE (SHE?) ENDS UP FINDING YOU.**  
> 
>**YOU PROGRESS THROUGH THE HOUSE BY PROVIDING TWO-WORD COMMANDS WHICH USUALLY CONTAIN A VERB AND THEN A NOUN BUT AREN'T ALWAYS IN THAT ORDER. EXAMPLES ARE <ins>WATER ON</ins> AND <ins>OPEN DOOR</ins>. IF A SET OF WORDS DOESN'T SEEM TO BE WORKING TRY A DIFFERENT TERMINOLOGY.**  
> 
>**IF YOU SHOULD FIND A STAIRCASE YOU MAY TRY <ins>UP STAIRS</ins> OR <ins>GO STAIRS</ins>. SOME OF THE ACTIONS YOU CAN TAKE ARE <ins>GET</ins>, <ins>DROP</ins>, <ins>GO</ins>, <ins>LOOK</ins>, <ins>READ</ins>, <ins>CLIMB</ins>, <ins>MOVE</ins>, <ins>HIT</ins>, <ins>KILL</ins>, ETC.**  
>

THE OTHER DIRECTIONS MAY ALSO BE ABBREVIATED AS WELL. WHEN YOUR WAY IS BLOCKED AND YOU CAN'T USE DIRECTIONS TO MOVE YOU MAY HAVE TO REFER TO THE ACTUAL OBJECT IN YOUR WAY. IN THESE CASES, YOU COULD TYPE <ins>GO DOOR</ins>, <ins>GO HOLE</ins>, <ins>GO GATE</ins>, ETC.**  
>
>**IN GENERAL THE TOP OF THE SCREEN IS <ins>NORTH</ins>. THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN IS <ins>SOUTH</ins>, THE LEFT SIDE IS <ins>WEST</ins>, AND THE RIGHT SIDE IS <ins>EAST</ins>. BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY OF DRAWING DOORWAYS TO THE <ins>SOUTH</ins> OR THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN, THERE ARE ONE OR TWO ROOMS WHERE THE DOORWAYS DO NOT MATCH UP TO THE NORMAL DIRECTIONS.**

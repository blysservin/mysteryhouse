**THIS **[[&nbsp;WALKTHROUGH&nbsp;]](/walkthrough.md)** IS INTENDED AS A COMPLETE GUIDE FOR THE APPLE II HI-RES ADVENTURE GAME *MYSTERY HOUSE* CREATED BY ROBERTA AND KEN WILLIAMS (PUBLISHED BY ON-LINE SYSTEMS IN 1980 AND RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN IN 1987).**  

**ALL ROOMS IN THE HOUSE, ITEMS, AND POSSIBLE OUTCOMES ARE DETAILED TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE INCLUDING ALTERNATE ENDINGS BY DYING AS WELL AS THE OPTIONAL KILLING OF AN ADDITIONAL CHARACTER AND ACQUIRING OF AN OTHERWISE LOCKED OBJECT. REPEATED PROMPTS AND ACTIONS AND ALTERNATE PHRASINGS FOR COMMANDS ARE NOT INCLUDED EXCEPT FOR IN PLACES WHERE THE CONTEXT IS USEFUL FOR READERS OF THIS TEXT.**  

**THANK YOU TO ROBERTA WILLIAMS, KEN WILLIAMS, ON-LINE SYSTEMS / SIERRA ON-LINE, THE PUBLIC DOMAIN EXCHANGE, THE INTERNET ARCHIVE, AND THE MAME EMULATOR. THANKS ALSO TO THE DEDICATED PLAYERS BEFORE ME THAT HELPED WITH PARSING TOGETHER THE WORDS FOR <ins>POUR WATER</ins> AND <ins>WIPE ALGAE</ins> AND HOW TO GET OUT OF THE FOREST MAZE.**
